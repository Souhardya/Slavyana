## About The Project

There are many great sandbox products available; however, at the time I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I wanted to replicate sort of what Sandboxie was doing but in a niche non regular user oriented way and also at the time SandBoie was yet to be open sourced so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

So tldr I created Slavayna to stand as my experimental sandbox
